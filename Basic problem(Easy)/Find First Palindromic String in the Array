-->  Given an array of strings words, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return an empty string "".
    A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

--> Ex 1 : 
    Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
    Output: "ada"
    Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
    Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.

--> Ex 2 : 
    Input: words = ["notapalindrome","racecar"]
    Output: "racecar"
    Explanation: The first and only string that is palindromic is "racecar".

--> Code : 
    class Solution {
    public:
        string firstPalindrome(vector<string>& words) {
            string str ="";
            for (int i=0;i<words.size();i++){
                string s = words[i];
                for (int j=s.size()-1;j>=0;j--){
                    str = str + s[j];
                }
                if (str == s){
                    return str;
                }
                str = "";
            }
            return str ;
        }
    };
