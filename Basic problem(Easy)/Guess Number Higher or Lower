--> We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
    I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
    Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
    You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:
--> -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
     1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
     0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).

--> Ex 1:
    Input: n = 10, pick = 6
    Output: 6

--> Ex 2:
    Input: n = 1, pick = 1
    Output: 1

--> Ex 3 :
    Input: n = 2, pick = 1
    Output: 1

--> Code :
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *			      1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * int guess(int num);
