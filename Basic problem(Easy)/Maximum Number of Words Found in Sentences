--> A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.
    You are given an array of strings sentences, where each sentences[i] represents a single sentence.
    Return the maximum number of words that appear in a single sentence.

--> Ex 1 : 
    Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: 
    - The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.
    - The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.
    - The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in total.
    Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.

--> Code : 
    class Solution {
    public:
        int mostWordsFound(vector<string>& sentences) {
            int count = 0;
            int max_count = INT_MIN;
            for (int i=0;i<sentences.size();i++){
                string str = sentences[i];
                count = 0;
                for (int j=0;j<str.size();j++){
                    if (str[j] == ' '){
                        count ++;
                    }
                }
                count ++;
                if (max_count < count ){
                    max_count = count ;
                }
            }
            return max_count ;
        }
    };
