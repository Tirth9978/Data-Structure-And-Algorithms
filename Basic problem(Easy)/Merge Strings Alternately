--> You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, 
    starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
    Return the merged string.

--> Ex 1 : 
    Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
    Output: "apbqcr"
    Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
    word1:  a   b   c
    word2:    p   q   r
    merged: a p b q c r

--> Ex 2 : 
    Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
    Output: "apbqrs"
    Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
    word1:  a   b 
    word2:    p   q   r   s
    merged: a p b q   r   s

--> Code : 
    class Solution {
    public:
        string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
            int i =0;
            int j = 0;
            string str = "";
            while(i < word1.size() && j < word2.size()){
                str = str  + word1[i];
                i++;
                str = str + word2[j];
                j++;
            }
            while(i < word1.size()){
                str = str + word1[i];
                i++;
            }
            while(j < word2.size()){
                str = str + word2[j];
                j++;
            }
            return str ;
        }
    };
