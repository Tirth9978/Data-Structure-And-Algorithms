--> You are given two strings s and t.
    String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
    Return the letter that was added to t.

--> Example 1:

    Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
    Output: "e"
    Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

--> Code : 
    class Solution {
    public:
        char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
            sort(s.begin(),s.end());
            sort(t.begin(),t.end());
            int i =0;
            int j = 0;
            int ans = 0;
    
            while(i < s.size() || j < t.size()){
                if (s[i] != t[j]){
                    ans = t[j];
                    break;
                }
                i++;j++;
            }return ans;
        }
    };
